### EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS
Namal College (Associate College of the University of Bradford, UK)		                                 2012 – 2016 
BSc (Hons) Computer Science				1st Class Honours - Distinction (90%)
Selected for Student Exchange Programme for one semester to study at the University of Bradford, and spent the 6th semester of my degree in Bradford (2015).

Final Year Project (Published at ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing 2016)
Demonstrating an experimentation of Amazon Web Services (AWS) to build the game Bricks Breaking, distributed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) application. Using a local rendering model and infrastructure design, the game was implemented and tested with increasing number of live users, to study influence of traffic and bandwidth on experience.

### TECHNICAL SKILLS AND PROJECTS
•	Virtual Broadband Remote Access Server (B-RAS): Developed a customized version of B-RAS according to customers’ needs using C as a programming language. I was specifically handing IP assignment and IP Pool management part of the system. Also, managed main repository of the team.
•	Games for Cloud Computing: An individual research project involving study of cloud friendliness for different game genre. After separating a ‘cloud friendly’ game type, a simple game was implemented and deployed on Amazon infrastructure. (Published at 31st IEEE ICOIN)
•	DoS attacks (A research study): The research study involved various aspects of DoS attacks. Different ways of launching and detecting the mentioned type of cyber-attack.
•	Snails Game with Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Matlab): Individual project to formulate Snails (area capturing game), and AI agent was created using Decision tree, Min-Max algorithm and heuristic.
•	Tanks Game with AI (Matlab): Crafted Tanks Battle game in Matlab and its agent was designed using A* algorithm for path finding.
•	Serendipity (Python): A file storage System, which was Redundant, Distributed, and Encrypted. We have used Python language as backend as well as for frontend.
•	Skin Segmentation using Fuzzy Logic (Matlab): The system was able to classify a skin pixel using R, G, B colour space. By using Fuzzy C-mean Clustering and decision tree, a Fuzzy inference system was built. 
•	Breast cancer detection using Neural Networks (Matlab): The system was able to detect breast cancer using some attributes of Breast cell. Neural networks were used in Matlab to obtain desired results.
•	Chess Game with AI (C++): Chess game with an intelligent agent was written in C++. 
•	Checkers Game with AI (Java): Using Java, a GUI based Checkers game with AI agent was created.
•	Skills: C, Java, C++, Python, AWS, Matlab, Latex
